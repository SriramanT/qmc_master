# qmc_master

This repository is part of a MSc in Physics Engineering final project consisting of applying Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to a problem of interacting fermions. We refer the interested reader to the thesis available at

[Thesis](https://github.com/fmonteir/qmc_master_thesis/blob/master/thesis/thesis.pdf)

The aim of this work was to carry out a theoretical study (with particular emphasis on numerical aspects) of the properties of a TMD (transition metal dichalcogenide) nanoribbon - a graphene-like 2D nanostructure where electron interactions are particularly relevant - using a QMC method.

## Getting started

In an attempt to mimic a usual practice in computer science, I decided to write a readme file to help me (and others) navigate through my project directories. The idea was to organize and document the material I found and created over the course of my research on this topic. The content of the project directories are exhaustively explained and every relevant folder or file is briefly commented in the corresponding repositories.

I divided my work in three repositories:

[Thesis itself](https://github.com/fmonteir/qmc_master_thesis)

[References](https://github.com/fmonteir/msc_references)

[Code](https://github.com/fmonteir/qmc_master_code)


## This repo

In this repository I gathered all the 'miscellaneous' material related to my thesis: presentations, rough lecture notes, posters, early attempts at implementing the code, etc.

The wikipedia page on QMC (and references therein :) ) is a good start to begin learning about QMC.

[AFQMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary-field_Monte_Carlo)

More specifically, we use auxiliary field QMC. Wikipedia has little information, but it does point to
some useful references.

The homepage of Alps contains many interesting explorations having to do
with methods for strongly correlated systems in general, not only Monte Carlo.
