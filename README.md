# qmc_master

This repository is part of a MSc Physics Engineering final project consisting of applying Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to a problem of interacting fermions.

## Getting started

In an attempt to mimic an usual practice in computer science, I decided to write a readme file to help me (and others) navigate through my project folders. The idea is to organize and document the material I found and created over the course of my research on this topic. The content of the project folder is exhaustively explained and every relevant folder or file is briefly commented in another repository.

## This repo

In this repository I gathered all the miscellaneous material related to my thesis: presentations, rough lecture notes, posters, etc.
