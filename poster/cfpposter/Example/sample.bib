abstract = {Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, while being efficient for bosons, suffer from the "negative sign problem" when applied to fermions--causing an exponential increase of the computing time with the number of particles. A polynomial time solution to the sign problem is highly desired since it would provide an unbiased and numerically exact method to simulate correlated quantum systems. Here we show that such a solution is almost certainly unattainable by proving that the sign problem is nondeterministic polynomial (NP) hard, implying that a generic solution of the sign problem would also solve all problems in the complexity class NP in polynomial time.},

@inproceedings{Bai2006,
abstract = {One of the core problems in materials science is how the interactions between electrons in a solid give rise to properties like magnetism, superconductivity, and metal-insulator transitions? Our ability to solve this central question in quantum statistical mechanics numerically is presently limited to systems of a few hundred electrons. While simulations at this scale have taught us a considerable amount about certain classes of materials, they have very significant limitations, especially for recently discovered materials which have mesoscopic magnetic and charge order. In this paper, we begin with an introduction to the Hub- bard model and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The Hubbard model is a simple and effective model that has successfully cap- tured many of the qualitative features of materials, such as tran- sition metal monoxides, and high temperature superconductors. Because of its voluminous contents, we are not be able to cover all topics in detail; instead we focus on explaining basic ideas, concepts and methodology of quantum Monte Carlo simulation and leave various part for further study. Parts of this paper are our recent work on numerical linear algebra methods for quantum Monte Carlo simulations.},

@article{Santos2003,
abstract = {We tutorially review the determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo method for fermionic systems, using the Hubbard model as a case study. Starting with the basic ingredients of Monte Carlo simulations for classical systems, we introduce aspects such as importance sampling, sources of errors, and finite-size scaling analyses. We then set up the preliminary steps to prepare for the simulations, showing that they are actually carried out by sampling discrete Hubbard-Stratonovich auxiliary fields. In this process the Green's function emerges as a fundamental tool, since it is used in the updating process, and, at the same time, it is directly related to the quantities probing magnetic, charge, metallic, and superconducting behaviours. We also discuss the as yet unresolved "minus-sign problem", and two ways to stabilize the algorithm at low temperatures.},

@article{Hirsch1983,
abstract = {We discuss a new functional-integral formulation of interacting fermion systems on a lattice such as the Anderson or Hubbard models: the fermion-fermion interaction is eliminated by introducing auxiliary Ising variables. The resulting model for a d-dimensional quantum system is a (d+1)-dimensional Ising model with complicated interactions. The new transformation is particularly useful for performing numerical studies of these models using Monte Carlo techniques. We study its convergence properties and compare it with the usual Gaussian formulation for the case of the Hubbard model.},

@book{Newman1999,
abstract = {This book provides an introduction to Monte Carlo simulations in classical statistical physics and is aimed both at students beginning work in the field and at more experienced researchers who wish to learn more about Monte Carlo methods. It includes methods for both equilibrium and out of equilibrium systems, and discusses in detail such common algorithms as the Metropolis and heat-bath algorithms, as well as more sophisticated ones such as continuous time Monte Carlo, cluster algorithms, multigrid methods, entropic sampling and simulated tempering. Data analysis techniques are also explained starting with straightforward measurement and error-estimation techniques and progressing to topics such as the single and multiple histogram methods and finite size scaling. The last few chapters of the book are devoted to implementation issues, including lattice representations, efficient implementation of data structures, multispin coding, parallelization of Monte Carlo algorithms, and random number generation. The book also includes example programs which show how to apply these techniques to a variety of well-known models.},

  abstract={Using the determinant quantum Monte-Carlo method, we elucidate the strain tuning of edge magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons. Our intensive numerical results show that a relatively weak Coulomb interaction may induce a ferromagnetic-like behaviour with a proper strain, and the edge magnetism can be enhanced greatly as the strain along the zigzag edge increases, which provides another way to control graphene magnetism even at room temperature.}

@article{Mohanty2012,
abstract = {Because of the edge states and quantum confinement, the shape and size of graphene nanostructures dictate their electrical, optical, magnetic and chemical properties. The current synthesis methods for graphene nanostructures do not produce large quantities of graphene nanostructures that are easily transferable to different substrates/solvents, do not produce graphene nanostructures of different and controlled shapes, or do not allow control of GN dimensions over a wide range (up to 100 nm). Here we report the production of graphene nanostructures with predetermined shapes (square, rectangle, triangle and ribbon) and controlled dimensions. This is achieved by diamond-edge-induced nanotomy (nanoscale-cutting) of graphite into graphite nanoblocks, which are then exfoliated. Our results show that the edges of the produced graphene nanostructures are straight and relatively smooth with an I(D)/I(G) of 0.22-0.28 and roughness {\textless}1 nm. Further, thin films of GN-ribbons exhibit a bandgap evolution with width reduction (0, 10 and {\~{}}35 meV for 50, 25 and 15 nm, respectively).},
