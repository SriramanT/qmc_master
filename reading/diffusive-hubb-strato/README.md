# huy-nguyen's description

This is a fabulous article. It essentially shows how the introduction of auxiliary fields through the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation sets up a diffusion equation (with branching and drift) on the Grassmann manifold of normalized Slater determinants after a proper intrinsic coordinate system has been chosen on that manifold. In my opinion, this immediately links the sign problem in AFQMC with the sign problem in DMC (which is more intuitive to understand in configuration space).

They actually explicitly wrote down that diffusion equation and give an example in the simple context of a two-site Hubbard model. There are lots of great insights peppered throughout this article.

However, tried as I may, I couldn’t really understand the appendix which is where they did the change of variable from the auxiliary fields to the coordinates of the manifold. If you understand it, I’d love to hear from you!

Fun trivia: you’ll notice that in the bibliography they cite one of their unpublished papers (ref 27) which for some reason was actually published in 1990, before this paper came out. In that 1990 paper (see below), they established the positive projection method based on insights developed in the current paper.
