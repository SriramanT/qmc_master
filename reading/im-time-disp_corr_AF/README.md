# huy nguyen's description

One of the core ideas of my thesis is based on these two papers. In the first paper, based on the simple observation that the Green’s function is a projector, the authors show an elegant yet efficient and numerically stable way to calculate the imaginary-time Green’s function with AFQMC with Metropolis-like sampling.

The second paper is a very comprehensive lecture note. It reviews the basics of AFQMC and discusses available techniques to calculate the Green’s functions.
