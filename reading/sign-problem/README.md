# huy-nguyen's description (Troyer_2005)

This paper proves that the fermion sign problem that afflicts all QMC methods is indeed NP-hard which implies a general solution to the fermion sign problem will also prove that P = NP, a $1 million Milllennium prize problem. (If you do find one such solution, donâ€™t forget to let me know.) The paper also provides a very clear definition of the sign problem and shows how that arises in a finite-temperature QMC method.
