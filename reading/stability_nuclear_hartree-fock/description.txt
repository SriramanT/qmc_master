# Description

This quite old paper from the outset doesn’t seem to have anything to do with QMC but it does in a big way. The most important result we need is the theorem in section 2 which has come to be known as Thouless theorem: the application of the exponential of a one-body operator to a Slater determinant is another Slater determinant (although you can see that it wasn’t stated that way in this paper). I provide a proof of this in an appendix of my thesis.

This has huge implications because if we can write all operations on Slater determinants in a second-quantized QMC algorithm in the form of such operators then the number of determinants we need will not increase over time because of the operators themselves (although the number might increase due to branching but that certainly is not inherent to the algorithm).

Fun trivia: My Reed thesis advisor (Prof. Schroeter) attended Reed with Thouless’s daughter. Thouless won the 2016 Nobel prize in physics.
